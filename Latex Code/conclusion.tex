\chapter*{Conclusion}
Our model working very well, Now WISD Education could determine the hot leads and passe it to the sales team and without doubt the conversion rate will be more higher from the past because now the employees in this team will have a big chance to find the people which more or just few more interested in the WISD Education or its products with that the possibility of the conversion being higher for sure. Yes! we did it!! now every one happy we are in the top level of data science technologies ... Wait a minute there is more ? Yes, there is more . For now based on specific data we can determine the score of a lead but what about the time and the competition which is something that couldn't represented in the tables .or even his emotions at the moment, take an example where some one is very interested in the books provided in WISD Education, but after a while he will see a new competitive brand with new offers , so when the someone from the team call him he will say no or am not interested . All these are very hard to be implemented in a static model like ours. So there is a much more complicated concept named Time Series Models which are simply another type of models that uses variations through time and adapt based on this changes or even predict the future . Here a bunch of questions appear in our heads, how we could do that ? How it is possible to use time ? How we train a model that uses the time to predict through the time ? and more questions. Like the quote says  "The future is made of the same stuff as the present".
